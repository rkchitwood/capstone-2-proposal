# Project Proposal

## Project Management App

1. Node and React
2. This will be relatively even, although the front-end UI for the page listing all projects will have to be quite robust
3. this will be a website
4. the goal of my project is to allow organizations to delegate projects efficiently, capturing relevant data without overcrowding the view of all users
5. This will be used by essentially any organization with a need for product or project managers with an additional need by companies with WFH employees.
6. the data of this app will be provided by users. A project manager will create projects and assign to team members.
